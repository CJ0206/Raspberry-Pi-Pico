# Smart Notice Board

This project uses a 16x2 I2C LCD display connected to a Pico W to show a predefined or custom message, along with the notice boards IP address.

## 16×2 I2C LCD Display
A 16×2 I2C LCD Display is a type of liquid crystal display (LCD) that can display information. Each of its two lines can contain up to 16 characters. It is called an I2C LCD because it uses the I2C communication protocol to communicate with other devices, such as microcontrollers like Raspberry Pi Pico or Arduino.

## Connecting the I2C LCD to the Pico W

The connection between the Raspberry Pi Pico and I2C LCD is straightforward as shown below in the schematic:

| I2C LCD Display | Raspberry Pi Pico W |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| VCC	VBUS pin. | This is the power from the microUSB bus (5-volts). |
| SDA	| GP0 (I2C0 SDA) |
| SCL	| GP1 (I2C0 SCL) |
| GND	| GND |

## MicroPython Code – Web Controlled Notice Board Using Pico W

The code is divided into four parts. Namely, the parts are i2c_lcd.py, lcd_api.py, secrets.py & the fourth part is main.py. The LCD doesn’t run directly as it requires some libraries.

`secrets.py` is used to set up the Wi-Fi network by providing the SSID and password. You will need to update the Wi-Fi SSID and password in the code with your network.

Row 17 of `main.py` sets our SDA pin, while row 18 sets our SCL pin.

Rows 53 to 65 of `main.py` can be removed from your setup, these were included so a random person cannot update the notice board, this is a very insecure method of locking down the webpage generated by the Pico as `Really_Secure_Password` could be read using page inspect or view page source, it also requires the user to put the password in after every interaction when the page reloads.

```
    <SCRIPT language="JavaScript">
    <!--hide
    var password;
    var pass1="Really_Secure_Password";
    password=prompt('Please enter your password to view this page:','');
    if (password==pass1)
      alert('Password verified, click OK to enter!');
    else
       {
        window.location.reload();
        }
    //-->
    </SCRIPT>
```

Rather than type a new message each time I set up a few buttons which automatically post a message, if you wanted to update or create your own just change `" Free"` to whatever you want to post to your display on the I2C and `"Free"` to whatever you want displayed on the button.

There is an issue where the first character is not displayed, this is why there is a space before each of the statuses, if you set a custom message you should start it with a space or the first character will be missing.

```
                  <th>
                      <form method="post">
                          <input type="hidden" id="msg" name="Message" value=" Free">
                          <input type="submit" value="Free">
                      </form>
                  </th>
```
